# 🔬 MIT Capstone Projects – Customer Conversion & Loan Default Risk Prediction

### 📆 March – June 2025

**MIT Professional Education – Machine Learning Capstone Series**
Developed and deployed predictive machine learning models to solve two high-impact, real-world business problems—customer subscription classification and loan default risk estimation—using Python and data science techniques.

## 🧠 Project 1: Customer Conversion Prediction

**Objective:** Predict whether a customer will subscribe to a product using historical marketing interaction data.

* 🧼 **Data:** 4,000+ customer records with encoded variables and engineered features
* 🧠 **Models Used:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree
* 📊 **Techniques:** Decision boundaries, feature importance, confusion matrix
* ✅ **Outcome:** Identified key behavioral indicators and achieved clean class separations
* 🎯 **Business Value:** Improved customer targeting and campaign ROI for marketing teams

📂 **Artifacts:**

* `MIT Potential Customers Prediction Code.html` – Full working notebook
* `MIT Code Capstone Project.pdf` – Final report and insights summary

## 🧠 Project 2: Loan Default Risk Prediction

**Objective:** Estimate probability of loan default using real-world borrower data across 13 features.

* 🧼 **Data:** 5,960 loan records, cleaned and transformed for supervised learning
* 🧪 **Models Tested:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
* 🔧 **Tuning:** GridSearchCV optimized the Random Forest model
* 📈 **Performance:** 90% accuracy and 0.96 ROC-AUC
* 💡 **Business Value:** Supports credit risk assessment and automated lending decisions in financial institutions
